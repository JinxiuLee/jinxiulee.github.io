        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>In the era of information explosion, it's becoming more and more difficult to find valuable information and manage them in the way we want.
        Mark is a wonderful place to find valuable information other users share and also a great tool to make highlights and notes on the articles and sync throughout all the users' devices.</p>

        <p>Every day, I read a lot of long articles, blogs, books using the browser.
        So many times, I need to highlight, note and save valuable sentences or paragraphs, but there is no tool which can meet my expectation.</p>

        <p>Kindle and Medium inspired me. When reading books and articles, I can always easily highlight, note and share the important contents. So next time I read the same book or article, all the highlights and notes I took last time show up.</p>

        <p>I came up with a solution which is to use browser extension to highlight, note, sync and use a mobile application to read the marked contents.</p>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>

        <p>After market research and competitors analysis I found that there are few similar products which provide the same function, but they either doesn't offer some important features or offer too complex solutions.</p>
        <p>
          My idea is very simple:<br>
          1. Design a simple browser extension to let users mark content.<br>
          2. Let users read their marked content and valuable content shared by other users.
        </p>

        <h3>The Challenge</h3>

        <p>This is my first time to design such a complex application from 0. I was involved into the process from the very beginning to the end all by myself.</p>

        <h3>Research</h3>

        <p>I downloaded and tried all the competitor products including Evernote, Diigo, Pocket, Raindrop, Linter... I got a lot of inspiration from them. On the other hand, the market research and competitors analysis helped me make the priorities to differentiate Mark from other product.</p>

        <h3>Persona Development</h3>

        <p>In order to test my idea and hypotheses, I made an Ad-Hoc Persona which will help understand the possible scenarios.</p>

            Recently he is reading an official document of a JS library.
            He wishes that there is a tool can help him record the position where he read last time, so next time he reads it, he may quickly find out where to start.

        <h3>Wireframe</h3>

        <p>I started with some quick sketches on the paper and outlined the main structure of the app. Then I moved to Sketch creating wireframes of Mark.</p>
        <h4>Chrome Extension</h4>
        <img data-layzr="/public/img/mark/chrome-wireframe@2x.png" alt="" />
        <h4>Mobile Application</h4>
        <img data-layzr="/public/img/mark/app-wireframe@2x.png" alt="" />
        <h3>Hi-Fi Mockups</h3>
        <p>Next step was to make the details of each screen, develop visual aesthetics and generate hi-fi mockups for each flows.</p>
        <h4>Chrome Extension</h4>
        <img data-layzr="/public/img/mark/chrome-hifi-mockup@2x.png" alt="" />
