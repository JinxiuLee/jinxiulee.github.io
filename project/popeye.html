        <h3>Ideation</h3>
        <p>In order to hear the voice from our internal truck experts, we also had an internal ideation workshop in April, 2019. 16 experts from 13 departments are attended. In the workshop, attendees were separated into 3 groups. Each group stands for different customer unit and comes up ideas from different perspectives.

        Through the internal ideation, we collected 91 frictions, for 8 main frictions, 47 solutions and in the end we got our top 3 ideas.
