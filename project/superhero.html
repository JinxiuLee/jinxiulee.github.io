                <h3>About Superhero</h3>
                <p>
                    SuperHero was the first project incubated from 0 to 1 in Lab1886 China.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mercedes-Benz Test Drive Platform in Chengdu owns a very large fleet, which costs a lot of money every year. In order to reduce the cost and at the same time make additional revenue we incubated Superhero, a luxury car rental platform which shares the same fleet with Mercedes-Benz Test Drive Platform.

                <p>After the product launched for about 1 month, we also made phone call to our users for getting the feedbacks including their future use scenario and the reason behind why they didn't order the product. </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    For the users who can accept the price of their desired model, the main future scenario will be travel.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    For Chengdu users, the price is the main concern not making an order
                  </li>
                  <li>

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Users show interest in renting a car before buying, but still with concern with the cost
